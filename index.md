## Prerequisite

1. Good knowledge of C++. We will start the course with a quick review of C++, but the pace is fast and the emphasis will be on features of "modern" C++, such as move semantics, lambdas,smart pointers...
1. Basic knowledge of computer architecture course, such as CPU instructions, registers, RAM and cache.

## Assessment

All homeworks require the use of Github where your submission is autograded. A basic knowledge of Git and a Github account is mandatory.
