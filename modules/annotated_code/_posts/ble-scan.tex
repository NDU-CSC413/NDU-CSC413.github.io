By looking at the figure it is clear that the value at node $A$ is the sum of the values of its children.
The index of node $A$ is at $2^{h+1}-1$ which is the same as its right child. The left child of $A$ has index $2^h-1$. Let $S$ be the array then 
\begin{align*}
    S[2^{h+1}-1]=S[2^h-1]+S[2^{h+1}-1]
\end{align*}
For node $B$ it is the same except we shift the indices by $2^{h+1}$ to the right.
Therefore for nodes at level $h+1$ we have 
\begin{align*}
    S[k+2^{h+1}-1]=S[k+2^h-1]+S[k+2^{h+1}-1]
\end{align*}
where $k$ starts with 0 and is incremented by $2^{h+1}$.

        $S[k+2^{h+1}-1]=S[k+2^h-1]+S[k+2^{h+1}-1]$\;
    }
\end{algorithm*}
